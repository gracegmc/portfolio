      <h2>Proposition: America's Abortion Clinics Are Scarce, with Many Areas Having no Local Providers</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="value_bins.png" alt="choropleth map, bins with value"/>
          <figcaption>choropleth map of US states by percentage of counties <strong><u>without</u></strong> abortion clinics, 
              using percentage values for bin cutoffs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I chose to use a choropleth map because it allows for easy intuitive association between 
              the geographical location, the state, and the value range indicated by the colors (score: 2, fully earnest). 
          </li>
          <li>I chose a color scheme that transitioned from <u><strong>red to blue</strong></u> because I felt like abortion is a 
              politically charged topic, and by assigning <strong>red-ish hues</strong> to states that lack abortion clinics, 
              it reinforces the correlation to the <strong>Republican</strong> ideologies/policies. The same arguement applies 
              for the choice of <strong>blue</strong> at the other end of the spectrum, representing abudance in abortion care, 
              aligning with <strong>Democratic</strong> ideologies (score: 2, fully earnest). 
          </li>
          <li>I chose to bin the values into 5 even bins, each bin representing a 20% range. I chose 5 discrete bins to avoid
              <u><strong>just noticable difference</strong></u>. I chose to bin the data using the exact values instead of 
              percentiles to obtain a more accurate visual distribution of data values (score: 2, fully earnest).

          </li>
          <li>I chose to bin the values into 5 bins based on percentile, each bin representing a 20% of data values. This 
            means around 10 states will have the same color, and the 5 colors will be evenly distributed amongst the states. 
            I chose 5 discrete bins to avoid <u><strong>just noticable difference</strong></u>. I chose to bin the data 
            using percentiles instead of exact values for a better visual balance, and avoid the map being overpowered by 
            the skewed data distribution. Binning by percentile also allows for relative comparisons between the different
            states. However binning by percentile will flatten the differences, and each bin range/width can vary but the 
            visualize will imply equal width even when it is untrue (score: -2, fully deceptive).

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>I think figuring out how to plot a choropleth map was fairly straightforward, converting values into bins, 
            but having the bins display in ascending order was a bit harder. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was surprised that binning by percentile and binning by data values resulted in such different graphs. 
            There was an example from lecture 5 (page 54) that showed the use of quantiles instead of evenly spaced bins 
            for the discrete color cut-off in a choropleth map that achieved a more balanced color distribution across 
            the maps. I was inspired by this example and attempted to plot two choropleth map, one using evenly spaced 
            bins and the other using quantiles. I think the reason why there was a much more significant difference between 
            the choropleth map of the percentile bins and evenly distributed bins is because the distribution of the 
            “percentage of counties without abortion clinics” is a much more skewed set of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that choices that make the visualization more intuitive and easier to understand are acceptable persuasive 
          choices. The intention behind the choice and the consequences of the choice matter a lot when distinguishing between 
          acceptable and misleading choices. If the visualization choice is made with the intent to persuade a specific case, 
          and without the choice the case supported by the visualization, then it should be classified as a misleading choice. 
          Acceptable visualization choices should help clarify points in the data or make the data easier to understand 
          (eg. redundancy).
